mcc - a standard c compiler

_NOT_ finished yet.

The compiler is designed to be able to compile itself, so it is written in C. And it refuses to use any gnu extension, _ONLY_ pure standard syntax. It is intended to support all C99 language features while keeping the code as simple and small as possible.

To build the mcc compiler, run command:

	make

To run the testing suite, run command:

	make test


Source Roadmap:

include		headers files provided by this compiler.

sys		system relative utilities.

test		test suite.
