7cc - a standard C compiler

The compiler is designed to be able to compile itself, so it is written in C. And it is intended to support all C99 language features while keeping the code as simple and small as possible.


Source Roadmap:

Documentation   Documentation.

include		Header files provided by this compiler.

sys		System relative utilities.

utils		Common utilities (system independent).

test		Test suite.


HOWTO build:

For Linux users:

To build the compiler, run command:

   make

To build the bootstrap compiler, run command:

   make bootstrap

To run the test suite:

   make test


For Windows users:

Install Visual Studio 2015, then open `VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`:

   nmake -f makefile.nt


For Mac OS X users:

Nowadays OS X is shipped with Apple's C library headers, which does _NOT_ support a standard compiler. You can still build the compiler like Linux, but cannot include the standard headers.
