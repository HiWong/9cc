mcc - a standard C compiler

_NOT_ finished yet.

The compiler is designed to be able to compile itself, so it is written in C. And it refuses to use any gnu extension, _ONLY_ pure standard syntax. It is intended to support all C99 language features while keeping the code as simple and small as possible.


Source Roadmap:

Documentation   Documentation.

include		Header files provided by this compiler.

sys		System relative utilities.

utils		Common utilities (system independent).

test		Test suite.


HOWTO build:

For Linux users:

To build the mcc compiler, run command:

	make

For Mac OS X users:

Nowadays OS X is shipped with Apple's C library headers, which does _NOT_ support a standard compiler. You can still build the compiler like Linux, but cannot include the standard headers.
